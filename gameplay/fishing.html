		<p>Fishing is a skilled leisure activity that will help your pet regain focus, in addition to providing it with fish. To launch the fishing minigame, press the screen button with a fishing pole on it.</p>
		<h3 id="casting a line">Casting A Line</h3>
		<p>The quality of your cast influences the quality of the fish you can catch. A good cast lands close to the target, which is indicated by the red dot seen along the casting line. Your reticle will slide along the line. Press A to cast when it is right over top the target.</p>
		<h3 id="luring">Luring</h3>
		<p>Once your line is cast, you must attract a fish to your line. You will start with a free-moving reticle. Attract the fish's attention by moving your reticle into its field of view. Once the fish has locked on to your reticle, intercept the fish's mouth at the center of the screen to secure its interest. If you are too slow and fail to intercept the fish, you will have to re-cast.</p>
		<h3 id="biting">Biting</h3>
		<p>Once the fish and your bobber are locked into place, you must wait for the fish to bite. A bite is indicated by the bobber sinking underwater, and is accompanied by a ripple on the water. Not all ripples indicate a bite though -- you must pay attention to whether or not your bobber has sunk. As soon as the fish bites and the bobber is sunk, press A as fast as you can.</p>
		<h3 id="reeling">Reeling</h3>
		<p>Pressing A on a successful bite will take you to the final stage of a catch -- reeling. Higher quality fish are considerably harder to reel in than lower quality fish. To reel a fish in, you must fill the reel meter seen above the reel line.The reel line resembles a horizontally oriented version of the casting line, and the reel meter is the red progress bar above it. The reel meter fills as long as your reticle is within the target range, indicated by the red mark on the reel line. Hold or tap A to accelerate your reticle from left to right along the reel line.</p>
		<h3 id="inspection">Inspection</h3>
		<p>After you've reeled a fish in, you will be taken to the inspection screen. There, you can inspect the stats of the particular fish you caught as well as see how much XP you got from the whole affair.</p>
