		<p>To play with your pet, press the screen button with a pile of toy blocks on it. When you do, you will be prompted to select a toy from your inventory. Different toys enable different types of play.</p>
		<h3 id="laser pointer">Laser Pointer</h3>
		<p>The laser pointer is the toy you start out with. Guide the laser pointer around the apartment. The pet will try to pounce on it. If your pet catches the laser pointer, it will play with it. Enough playing and pouncing will restore your pet's spirit.</p>
