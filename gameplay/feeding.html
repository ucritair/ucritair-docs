		<p>Feeding your pet nutritious and delicious meals is the main way to restore its vigour and one way to gain XP. To launch the feeding minigame, press the screen button with a table setting on it. Once the minigame is launched, tapping around the feeding area will show you some visual hints.</p>
		<p>At a basic level, feeding consists of selecting food items from your inventory and arranging them into a meal on your critter's meal tray. Meals are judged by nutritional completeness and diversity, neatness of arrangement, and also style. Once a meal is submitted for your critter to eat, Inspector Reed will deliver some feedback on the meal. Use this feedback to inform the way you play the minigame.</p>

		<p>To open the inventory for selection, press the screen button with a rotor icon on it. Selected items will have a golden highlight around them. You may have up to 5 items selected at a time. Once you have selected the items you wish to work with, exit the inventory to see them on the counter above your critter's table. You may change which items you have selected at any time prior to meal submission.</p>
