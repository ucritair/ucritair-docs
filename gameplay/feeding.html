		Feeding your pet nutritious and delicious meals is the main way to restore its vigour and one way to gain XP. To launch the feeding minigame, press the screen button with a table setting on it. Once the minigame is launched, tapping around the feeding area will show you some visual hints.
		<br>
		At a basic level, feeding consists of selecting food items from your inventory and arranging them into a meal on your critter's meal tray. Meals are judged by nutritional completeness and diversity, neatness of arrangement, and also style. Once a meal is submitted for your critter to eat, Inspector Reed will deliver some feedback on the meal. Use this feedback to inform the way you play the minigame.

		<h3 id="selecting food">Selecting Food</h3>
		To open the inventory for selection, press the screen button with a rotor icon on it. Selected items will have a golden highlight around them. You may have up to 5 items selected at a time. Once you have selected the items you wish to work with, exit the inventory to see them on the counter above the critter's table. You may change which items you have selected at any time prior to meal submission.
		<br>
		<h3 id="arranging food">Arranging Food</h3>
		To arrange selected foods, drag them from the counter to the critter's meal tray. Make sure that any foods which you want included in the meal are within the tray's bounds. For optimal results, lay your foods out neatly with even spacing.
		<br>
		<h3 id="submission and feedback">Submission and Feedback</h3>
		To submit the meal you have constructed, press the screen button with an upload icon on it. Once your meal is submitted, you will see its overall grade as well as a breakdown of its grade in specific areas. You will also see feedback from Inspector Reed and the amount of vigour and XP earned from the meal.Inspector Reed's feedback is essential to understanding what kind of meals will get you and your critter the best results.
